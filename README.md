# DataRelease

What has been added so far:

-Unpublished light curves in Scolnic et al. 2021 in Sample directory.

SH0ES-2022

We are first making publicly available the new measurements of Cepheids in the optical and NIR as described in Riess et al. 2022 and Yuan et al. 2022
for the hosts of the original 19 SN Ia in Riess et al. (2016), NGC 4258 and the LMC which will allow one to do the style of analysis such as in Riess et al. (2016) with the pre-new release sample.  The expanded sample data and covariance matrix needed to use it will become available in the near term.  Please see details in those two papers which describe the new data and the various calibrations and improvements made over what was previously available.  As this is a new data release with real improvements, please use this instead of a prior data product.
